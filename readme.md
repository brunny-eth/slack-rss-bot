## Slack RSS Bot

This bot checks an RSS feed (or multiple) on a periodic basis (set to hourly but could be set to smaller or longer timeframes) and, once the bot is added to the correct channel, will create a new daily thread and drop in all daily posts from the RSS feed 

Useful for staying up-to-date with research channels (e.g., Arxiv posts) in an organized way with a larger team
